It is a web app designed to help with early detection of measles using deep learning. I made this project because the measles outbreak in West Texas, which is the state I'm in right now. I wanted to help people with limited healthcare to know when it's serious. I don't mean to replce doctors, this is merely a tool for people to use for diagnosis.
